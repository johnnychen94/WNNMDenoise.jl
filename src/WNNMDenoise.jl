    WNNM(noise_level; kwargs...)

Weighted nuclear norm minimization denoising algorithm.

!!! note
    To keep consistent with the original implementation[2], here we stick
    to the 0-255 value range world. If the image is 0-1 range, then the default
    parameters may not work at all.

# Arguments

- `noise_level`: the (estimated) gaussian noise level, used in the first WNNM iteration.

# Keywords

The default values of these keywords come from the original reference
implementation [2]. Except that `patch_size` in our implementation has
to be odd number.

- `K`: the number of WNNM iterations
- `δ`: step value for each WNNM iteration

keywords that control the block matching step, it can be scalar or a vector of length `K`. If it is
a vector then it specifies the values for each WNNM iteration

- `num_patches`: the number of matched patches.
- `patch_size`: patch size.
- `patch_stride`: the stride of each sliding window.
- `window_size`: non-local search size in block matching.

keywords that control the internal WNNM solver, which is a small threshold-svd loop
on the extracted block matching results.

- `λ`: weight constant used to estimate the remained noise level of each patch.
- `C`: weight constant in WNNM solver used by the original implementation.

# Examples

```julia
using TestImages, WNNMDenoise, ImageTransformations

# 1. load a clean image
#    0-255 range is required
clean_img = Float64.(imresize(testimage("cameraman") .* 255, ratio=0.5));

# 2. add guassian noise
σₙ = 40;
noisy_img = clean_img .+ σₙ .* randn(Float32, size(clean_img))

# 3. denoise using the WNNM denoiser
f = WNNM(40)
denoised_img = f(copy(noisy_img), noisy_img)
```

Optimizes the weighted nuclear norm minimization problem with a fixed point estimation

```math

The weight `w` is specially chosen so that it satisfies the condition of Corollary 1 in [1].
